# animation
learning the use the GSAP animation library! so far, I've build a few basic animations, using the gsap.to() function mostly. I've learned about the different properties the can be animated through gsap, timelines, and the play/pause/restart/reverse functionalities. Next step is working with some of the other plug ins and core functionalities to see what else can be done! Also interested in using these libraries in combination with REACT and finding out how that differs from the implementation within vanilla JS

Also - currently struggling to call multiple animations as an onhover effect. Was trying to use an eventlistener, but may need to user the onmouseover directly in html.
